# Exporter Tool (Subtitle Export)

This tool extracts the `voice` field from DASMLAB tutorial manifests and generates `.vtt` subtitle files for syncing narration.

## ðŸ”— Context

The exporter is part of the larger [`tutorial-generator`](../../) system that creates animated, narrated educational tutorials from structured YAML.

- It fits into the **post-processing** step of the toolchain.
- It parses YAML manifests from `tutorials/*.yaml`
- It outputs `.vtt` subtitle files used by the player or export-to-video pipelines.

## ðŸ›  Usage

```bash
cd tools/exporter
go run main.go ../../tutorials/sample_flux_demo.yaml > output.vtt
```
